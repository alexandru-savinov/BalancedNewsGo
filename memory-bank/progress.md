## Current Test Status

- Robust querying test **passes**.
- Several unrelated existing tests **fail** (API mocks, heuristic category).
- These failures **do not block** current development but should be addressed before release.
- Acceptable to **skip fixing these tests temporarily** to focus on core features.

## Impact of Recent Changes

The 2025 redesign and recent improvements have significantly enhanced the system's robustness, accuracy, and maintainability. The ensemble approach reduces LLM variability, while prompt refinements improve bias detection quality. API and frontend upgrades enable better user interaction and feedback collection. Continuous validation ensures ongoing improvements. Refactoring and SonarQube fixes have stabilized the codebase, paving the way for future enhancements.

### Article Page UI/UX Redesign Impact (April 2025)
- Enhanced user transparency with interactive bias visualization slider and detailed model tooltips.
- Improved page load speed and responsiveness via image optimization (responsive, lazy-loaded images).
- Increased user engagement through inline feedback options and modern, responsive layout.
- Supports future enhancements in explainability and user-driven feedback loops.

---

## Linter & Workspace Diagnostics

- Minor markdownlint warning in architecture plan (missing trailing newline).
- SonarQube warning: duplicated `"test content"` string in tests.
- `package unsafe is not in std` warning persists, likely residual misconfiguration.
- None of these block current work but should be cleaned up later.

---

## Next Steps

- Proceed with ranking algorithm design and implementation.
- Integrate ranking into API and frontend.
- Expand test coverage and fix failing tests in later QA phase.
- Address linter warnings and workspace issues during cleanup.

## Iterative Prompt and Model Refinement (April 2025)

- Implemented **multi-perspective prompt variants**: default, left-focused, center-focused, right-focused.
- Each variant includes tailored few-shot examples to improve bias detection across the spectrum.
- This supports **ensemble diversity** and enables more nuanced aggregation.
- Validation tool categorizes errors (`prompt_issue`, `model_failure`, `data_noise`) to guide targeted refinements.
- Next iterations will:
  - Adjust few-shot examples based on flagged error categories.
  - Tune ensemble aggregation heuristics (e.g., weighting, filtering).
  - Retrain or fine-tune models if persistent model failures are detected.
- All changes validated on labeled datasets before deployment.
- This iterative approach aims to continuously improve bias detection accuracy and robustness.

---

## Additional Recent Achievements (April 2025)

- Fully automated validation and feedback loop integrated into CI/CD.
- Continuous feedback ingestion with real-time dashboards for monitoring.
- Comprehensive QA framework implemented for regression and integration testing.
- Resolved outstanding SonarQube issues and lint warnings, improving code quality.

---

## Expanded Impact

These improvements have:

- **Increased stability** by catching regressions early through automation.
- **Enhanced accuracy** via continuous feedback-driven model adjustments.
- **Improved maintainability** by reducing technical debt and enforcing quality standards.

## April 2025: Ensemble Scoring Pipeline Enhancements

**Metadata:**
_Last updated: 2025-04-10_
_Author: Roo_
_Change type: Enhancement_

**Changelog:**
- Added detailed plan to enforce strict JSON output, adaptive re-prompting, model switching, logging, reprocessing, and prompt refinement.

---

### Overview

To reduce parse failures and unscored articles, the ensemble scoring pipeline will be enhanced with:

- **Strict JSON output enforcement** using delimiters and examples.
- **Adaptive re-prompting** and **model switching** on failures.
- **Improved logging and alerting** for repeated failures.
- **Automated reprocessing** of failed articles.
- **Refined prompt engineering** to minimize errors.

---

### Implementation Plan

**1. Enforce Strict JSON Output**

- Update prompts to instruct LLMs to respond **only** with JSON inside triple backticks.
- Include few-shot examples within delimiters.
- Extract JSON between delimiters before parsing.
- Add tests for noisy outputs.

**2. Adaptive Re-Prompting and Model Switching**

- Classify failures and adapt prompts accordingly.
- Retry with stricter prompts or alternative variants.
- Switch models if repeated failures occur.
- Log all attempts with metadata.

**3. Logging and Alerting**

- Log article ID, model, prompt, error type, and raw response.
- Track failure rates and trigger alerts on thresholds.
- Expose metrics for monitoring.

**4. Automated Reprocessing**

- Queue failed articles with metadata.
- Periodically reprocess with adaptive prompts/models.
- Escalate persistent failures.

**5. Prompt Refinement**

- Use explicit JSON instructions and examples.
- Develop multiple prompt variants.
- Empirically select best variants.
