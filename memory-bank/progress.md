## Overarching Objective

**Deploy the scoring system into production with robust, transparent, and maintainable data flow, error handling, and documentation.**

---

## Milestone Achieved: Production-Ready Scoring System (April 2025)

- **Scoring pipeline issues resolved:**  
  The end-to-end scoring pipeline (article selection, LLM model mapping, scoring job execution) was debugged and fixed. Logical model labels ("left", "center", "right") are now correctly mapped to actual LLM model names, and all required models are registered and available in the backend.
- **Verification:**  
  Article 788, which previously failed to receive a score, now displays a real, nonzero `CompositeScore` on the main page. Manual and automated checks confirm that scores are computed and displayed correctly for all main page articles.
- **Production-ready status:**  
  As of April 11, 2025, the scoring system is fully functional and production-ready. The pipeline has been verified in a production environment, and ongoing monitoring/documentation will continue as the system evolves.

## Actionable Next Steps

### 1. Clarify and Justify Handling of Missing Perspective Scores
- Review and document the logic in `llm.ComputeCompositeScore` for missing perspective scores.
- Justify or update the defaulting-to-zero approach; consider alternatives (e.g., exclude missing, flag incomplete).
- Update both code comments and [score_data_flow_analysis.md] to reflect the rationale and impact.

### 2. Disambiguate Frontend Data Retrieval Methods
- Audit frontend code to specify whether detail view uses JS fetch, htmx, or both for `/articles/{id}`.
- Update documentation to clarify the exact retrieval method(s) and ensure consistent error handling.

### 3. Complete Documentation of Score Display Logic
- Review and document how `CompositeScore` is formatted and displayed in both the main list and detail view.
- Ensure any differences are explained and justified in [score_data_flow_analysis.md].

### 4. Provide Rationale and Alternatives for Composite Score Formula **Done:**
- Add a section to documentation explaining the choice of `1.0 - abs(average)` for the composite score.
- Research and document at least two alternative aggregation formulas, with pros/cons.
- Propose a configurable mechanism for selecting the aggregation formula if appropriate.

#### CompositeScore Data Flow Review – April 2025

The composite score calculation was refactored to be fully configurable via a JSON config file, robust to missing or invalid data, and now outputs a confidence metric alongside each score. The API and backend logic were updated to support formula selection, thresholding, and confidence reporting for every score calculation.

**April 2025 Update:**
The `llm_scores` table now supports versioning of score records and includes a composite index on (`article_id`, `version`) for improved query performance. Pruning and scaling strategies have been documented, including recommendations for archiving old scores and migrating to a scalable database if needed.

### 5. Clarify Backend-Frontend Data Flow and Response Formats **Done:**
- Specify in documentation whether the main article list is rendered via JSON or HTML fragments, and how htmx is used.
- For all API endpoints, document exact JSON field names and response structure, including sample payloads.
- Ensure frontend and backend expectations are aligned.

### 6. Document Error Handling and Data Integrity Mechanisms
- Review and document how LLM scoring pipeline handles errors (API failures, invalid/missing scores).
- Specify handling of duplicate or updated scores for an article.
- Add this information to both code comments and [score_data_flow_analysis.md].

### 7. Future-Proof Data Source Assumptions
- Update documentation to clarify that RSS feeds are currently the only data source, but the system is designed for extensibility.
- Add a section describing how new data sources could be integrated.

### 8. Add Implementation Details and Dependencies
- For each step above, list required code changes, configuration updates, or documentation edits.
- Identify dependencies between steps (e.g., updating score calculation logic may require frontend/API changes).
- Create a checklist or table to track progress on each requirement.

## CompositeScore Data Flow Review – April 2025

This autonomous review systematically analyzed the end-to-end CompositeScore pipeline, from RSS ingestion to UI display, as documented in 'score_data_flow_analysis.md'. For each stage, both current-state debugging and actionable improvement recommendations were produced.

Key Findings by Section:

1. Score Display (UI/JS/CSS):
   - List and detail views have inconsistent error handling; list view is prone to JS errors if score data is missing.
   - No visual indicator of score confidence; tooltips and unified rendering logic are lacking.

2. Frontend Data Retrieval:
   - List view uses htmx as expected; detail view fetches a different endpoint than documented.
   - No frontend caching, loading indicators, or user-friendly error messages.

3. Backend API Endpoints:
   - No error/performance logging; inconsistent JSON structure between endpoints.
   - No API response caching, standardized error schema, or input validation.
   - All backend API endpoints now use a standardized JSON schema for success and error responses, with consistent input validation, error/performance logging, and response caching implemented.

4. Final Score Calculation/Transformation:
   - Missing/invalid scores default to 0, biasing results; no NaN/Inf handling.
   - Calculation logic is not configurable; no confidence metric.

5. Data Storage:
   - No explicit DB health check; missing index on `article_id` impacts performance.
   - No score versioning/history or data pruning; SQLite may not scale.

6. Data Processing/Aggregation:
   - Good error logging, but no escalation or panic handling; job scheduling is external.
   - No batching/parallelism, config-driven models/prompts, or API usage monitoring.
   
     _April 2025: The background scoring job was refactored to process articles in batches with parallel worker execution, dynamically select models from configuration, and log API usage statistics for all external model calls._

7. Raw Data Origin:
   - No pre-validation of feed URLs; network and parsing errors are logged but not retried.
   - Feed sources are hardcoded; no health checks or advanced extraction.


123a | **April 2025 Implementation:**
123b | Feed source definitions were moved to an external configuration file, health checks for connectivity and format were implemented and exposed via API, and extraction/normalization logic was refactored for greater robustness and flexibility.
Prioritized Recommendations:

- **Done:** Unify and robustly handle CompositeScore rendering in the UI, with tooltips and confidence indicators.

  CompositeScore rendering in both list and detail views is now unified, with robust error handling, tooltips explaining the score, and a visual confidence indicator based on model confidence.
- **Done:** Implement frontend caching, loading indicators, and user-friendly error messages.

  Frontend article list and detail views now use in-memory caching, display loading indicators during data fetches, and show clear, user-friendly error messages on failure.
- **Done:** Standardize backend API responses, add logging, input validation, and response caching.
- **In Progress:** Refactor score calculation to be configurable, robust to missing/invalid data, and output a confidence metric.
- **In Progress:** Add composite index and versioning to `llm_scores`; develop pruning and scaling strategies.
- **Done:** Enhance background job with batching, parallelism, config-driven models, and API usage monitoring.
- **Done:** Move feed sources to external config, add health checks, and improve extraction/normalization.

Conclusion:
The CompositeScore pipeline is functional but can be significantly improved in robustness, maintainability, and user experience by addressing the above recommendations. This review provides a clear roadmap for future enhancements and ongoing reliability.
