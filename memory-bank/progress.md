# Progress Update (April 9, 2025)

---

## Recent Achievements

- Implemented robust multi-attempt LLM querying with outlier filtering and averaging.
- Integrated robust querying into bias detection pipeline.
- Fixed Go environment issues without reinstalling, enabling builds and tests.
- Added dedicated test for robust querying logic, which passes successfully.

---

## Current Test Status

- Robust querying test **passes**.
- Several unrelated existing tests **fail** (API mocks, heuristic category).
- These failures **do not block** current development but should be addressed before release.
- Acceptable to **skip fixing these tests temporarily** to focus on core features.

---

## Linter & Workspace Diagnostics

- Minor markdownlint warning in architecture plan (missing trailing newline).
- SonarQube warning: duplicated `"test content"` string in tests.
- `package unsafe is not in std` warning persists, likely residual misconfiguration.
- None of these block current work but should be cleaned up later.

---

## Next Steps

- Proceed with ranking algorithm design and implementation.
- Integrate ranking into API and frontend.
- Expand test coverage and fix failing tests in later QA phase.
- Address linter warnings and workspace issues during cleanup.
