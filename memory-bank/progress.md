# Progress

## Recent Progress
- Toolchain issues resolved, improving build/test reliability
- Backend components integrated and operational end-to-end
- **OpenAI API integration completed, replacing mock LLMs**
- **Prompt engineering refined with configurable templates**
- **Bias detection enhanced with structured outputs and heuristics**
- **API expanded with endpoints for summaries, bias, and feedback**
- **Frontend improved with HTMX, summaries, bias info, and feedback forms**
- Backend audit completed, confirming modular design and identifying improvement areas
- RSS fetching, database storage, LLM summarization, and REST API all functional
- Minimal frontend operational with dynamic content loading
- Enabled **golangci-lint** with stricter rules and added `.golangci.yml` configuration.
- Fixed style issues and lint errors across the codebase.
- Added verbose logging and fixed a nil pointer bug in the LLM module.
- Resolved missing test data file errors, allowing tests to run more reliably.

## Current Focus
- Testing and validation of new features
- Collecting user feedback
- Planning future enhancements (multi-perspective extraction, source diversity)

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Expand diversity of news sources
2. Further improve LLM prompt engineering
3. Enhance bias detection algorithms
4. Add advanced comparison features
5. Refine frontend UI/UX
6. Implement advanced user feedback loop

## Known Issues
- LLM API latency and cost considerations
- Limited diversity of news sources
- Frontend usability and design improvements needed
- Multi-perspective extraction currently basic
- Bias detection logic can be further enhanced

## Test Suite Status

- **Resolved:** Previous errors caused by missing test data files have been fixed.
- **Remaining issues:** Several **logic tests in `internal/llm` still fail**.
  - These failures are primarily due to **inconsistent or incorrect bias detection outputs**.
  - The bias detection heuristics sometimes produce variable results, leading to test flakiness.
  - Further refinement of the bias detection logic and more deterministic test cases are needed to resolve these failures.
