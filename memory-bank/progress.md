# Progress Update (April 9, 2025)

---

## Recent Achievements

- Completed implementation of the **multi-model, multi-prompt ensemble** architecture for bias detection.
- Integrated **continuous bias scoring** with outlier filtering and averaging.
- Enhanced **API** with endpoints for user feedback, bias insights, and article management.
- Upgraded **frontend** with dynamic content loading, bias visualization, and inline feedback forms.
- Refined **prompt engineering** using configurable templates and few-shot examples.
- Established a **continuous validation and feedback loop** to improve model accuracy and reliability.
- Performed major **refactoring** to improve modularity, readability, and maintainability.
- Resolved key **SonarQube warnings**, reducing technical debt and improving code quality.
- Fixed Go environment issues without reinstalling, enabling builds and tests.
- Added dedicated tests for robust querying and ensemble logic, which pass successfully.

---

## Current Test Status

- Robust querying test **passes**.
- Several unrelated existing tests **fail** (API mocks, heuristic category).
- These failures **do not block** current development but should be addressed before release.
- Acceptable to **skip fixing these tests temporarily** to focus on core features.

## Impact of Recent Changes

The 2025 redesign and recent improvements have significantly enhanced the system's robustness, accuracy, and maintainability. The ensemble approach reduces LLM variability, while prompt refinements improve bias detection quality. API and frontend upgrades enable better user interaction and feedback collection. Continuous validation ensures ongoing improvements. Refactoring and SonarQube fixes have stabilized the codebase, paving the way for future enhancements.

---

## Linter & Workspace Diagnostics

- Minor markdownlint warning in architecture plan (missing trailing newline).
- SonarQube warning: duplicated `"test content"` string in tests.
- `package unsafe is not in std` warning persists, likely residual misconfiguration.
- None of these block current work but should be cleaned up later.

---

## Next Steps

- Proceed with ranking algorithm design and implementation.
- Integrate ranking into API and frontend.
- Expand test coverage and fix failing tests in later QA phase.
- Address linter warnings and workspace issues during cleanup.
