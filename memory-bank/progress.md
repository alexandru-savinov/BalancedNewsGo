## Overarching Objective

**Deploy the scoring system into production with robust, transparent, and maintainable data flow, error handling, and documentation.**

---

## Milestone Achieved: Production-Ready Scoring System (April 2025)

- **Scoring pipeline issues resolved:**  
  The end-to-end scoring pipeline (article selection, LLM model mapping, scoring job execution) was debugged and fixed. Logical model labels ("left", "center", "right") are now correctly mapped to actual LLM model names, and all required models are registered and available in the backend.
- **Verification:**  
  Article 788, which previously failed to receive a score, now displays a real, nonzero `CompositeScore` on the main page. Manual and automated checks confirm that scores are computed and displayed correctly for all main page articles.
- **Production-ready status:**  
  As of April 11, 2025, the scoring system is fully functional and production-ready. The pipeline has been verified in a production environment, and ongoing monitoring/documentation will continue as the system evolves.

## Actionable Next Steps

### 1. Clarify and Justify Handling of Missing Perspective Scores
- Review and document the logic in `llm.ComputeCompositeScore` for missing perspective scores.
- Justify or update the defaulting-to-zero approach; consider alternatives (e.g., exclude missing, flag incomplete).
- Update both code comments and [score_data_flow_analysis.md] to reflect the rationale and impact.

### 2. Disambiguate Frontend Data Retrieval Methods
- Audit frontend code to specify whether detail view uses JS fetch, htmx, or both for `/articles/{id}`.
- Update documentation to clarify the exact retrieval method(s) and ensure consistent error handling.

### 3. Complete Documentation of Score Display Logic
- Review and document how `CompositeScore` is formatted and displayed in both the main list and detail view.
- Ensure any differences are explained and justified in [score_data_flow_analysis.md].

### 4. Provide Rationale and Alternatives for Composite Score Formula **Done:**
- Add a section to documentation explaining the choice of `1.0 - abs(average)` for the composite score.

## Memory Bank Update Log

[2025-04-12 12:06:27] - Memory Bank Update (UMB) completed at user request. All session context and clarifications synchronized to memory-bank files.
[2025-04-12 16:09:58] - Debug session: Identified OpenRouter rate limit as root cause of scoring failure. Multiple tool attempts to patch reanalyzeHandler; provided manual patch instructions. Memory Bank updated (UMB) at user request.

[2025-04-12 16:31:00] - Added secondary API key to .env file.
[2025-04-12 16:31:00] - Added secondary API key to .env file.
[2025-04-12 18:41:45] - UMB: Updated models in config, added secondary API key. New JSON parsing error (markdown backticks) identified with tokyotech-llm model. Debug task cancelled by user; decided to ignore parsing error for now.
[2025-04-12 19:28:30] - Fixed score display issue: Modified getArticlesHandler in internal/api/api.go to use stored ensemble score instead of recalculating.
[2025-04-12 19:28:30] - Fixed score display issue: Modified getArticlesHandler in internal/api/api.go to use stored ensemble score instead of recalculating.

[2025-04-13 17:23:23] - Added and documented a comprehensive Postman-based rescoring workflow test plan (see memory-bank/postman_rescoring_test_plan.md). Plan covers test case design, environment setup, data preparation, request sequencing, response validation, edge case handling, expected outcomes, and automation for regression testing.
