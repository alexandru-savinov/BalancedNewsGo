# Active Context

## Backend Status (Post-Implementation)

### RSS Fetching
- Fully implemented via `internal/rss`
- Fetches and parses multiple news sources reliably

### Database
- SQLite schema operational
- Stores raw articles and LLM analysis results
- Repository pattern abstracts DB access

### LLM Integration
- **OpenAI API fully integrated, replacing mock services**
- **Prompt engineering refined with configurable templates**
- **Bias detection enhanced with structured outputs and heuristics**
- Summarization and bias detection functional via OpenAI
- Multi-perspective extraction basic, planned for future refinement

### API
- REST API operational via `internal/api`
- Serves articles, summaries, and bias data
- **Endpoints for user feedback, comparison, and bias insights implemented**

### Frontend
- Improved UI with htmx dynamic loading
- Displays articles, summaries, bias info
- Supports inline user feedback submission
- Responsive and accessible design

## Current Focus
- Testing and validation of new features
- Collecting user feedback
- Planning future enhancements (multi-perspective extraction, source diversity)

## Recent Changes
- Toolchain issues fixed, improving build/test reliability
- Backend audit completed, confirming modular design is sound
- **OpenAI API integration completed and verified**
- Backend components integrated and functional end-to-end
- Frontend enhanced with summaries, bias info, and feedback forms

## Next Steps
- Expand diversity of news sources
- Further improve LLM prompt engineering
- Enhance bias detection algorithms
- Add advanced comparison features
- Refine frontend UI/UX
- Implement advanced user feedback loop
