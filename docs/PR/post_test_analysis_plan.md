# Post-Test Analysis and Plan

This document outlines the findings from the recent test execution and proposes a plan for addressing the identified issues.

## 1. Recap of Test Execution and Results

The following tests were executed based on the guidance in `docs/testing.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/codebase_documentation.md`.

### 1.1 Newman API Tests (via `scripts/test.cmd`)

- **Test Suites Executed:** `essential`, `backend`, `api` (all invoked via `scripts/test.cmd <suite_name>`).
- **Observation:** It appears all three command arguments (`essential`, `backend`, `api`) currently trigger the execution of the same Newman collection: `postman/unified_backend_tests.json`.
- **Results:**
    - All 61 assertions within the `postman/unified_backend_tests.json` collection **PASSED** consistently across all three invocations.
    - This indicates that the core API functionalities covered by this specific collection are working as expected (e.g., article creation, retrieval, feedback submission, rescoring basics, cache functionality).
- **Script Issue:** The `scripts/test.cmd` batch script itself exited with code 1 after each Newman run, displaying a PowerShell-specific error: "`. was unexpected at this time.`". This suggests an issue within the test script's cleanup or server shutdown phase, rather than a failure in the Newman tests themselves.

### 1.2 Go Unit Tests (via `go test ./...`)

- **Environment:** `NO_AUTO_ANALYZE='true'` was set as required.
- **Results:**
    - **`internal/api`:** Passed (cached, indicating prior success).
    - **`internal/db`:** Passed (cached, indicating prior success).
    - **`internal/llm`:** **FAILED**. This aligns with the known issue documented in `docs/testing.md`. Specific failures include:
        - **`TestComputeCompositeScoreEdgeCases`** (located in `composite_score_test.go`):
            - `NaN_values`: Issues with how NaN score values are handled or asserted.
            - `ignore_invalid_with_config_override`: Problems with the logic for ignoring invalid scores based on configuration.
            - `duplicate_model_scores_-_should_use_last_one`: Logic for handling duplicate model entries might be incorrect.
        - **`TestComputeWithMixedModelNames`** (located in `model_name_handling_test.go`):
            - Failures indicate potential issues with normalizing, mapping, or calculating scores when model names have varied casing or include vendor prefixes/tags.
        - **`TestIntegrationUpdateArticleScore`** (located in `score_manager_integration_test.go`):
            - Multiple assertion failures related to database mock expectations (e.g., expected SQL not being called or called with different parameters).
            - Discrepancies in expected vs. actual final scores and confidence values.
            - Incorrect status/step/percentage reported by the progress manager in the mocked scenario.
        - **`TestIntegrationUpdateArticleScoreCalculationError`** (located in `score_manager_integration_test.go`):
            - Error messages not matching expectations when a calculation error is simulated.
        - **`TestScoreManagerIntegrationCalculateScoreError`** (located in `score_manager_integration_test.go`):
            - Similar to above, issues with error propagation or checking when score calculation fails.
    - Many log messages from the LLM tests indicate problems around zero confidence scores, handling of invalid scores, and perspective mapping.

## 2. Key Areas for Investigation and Action

Based on the test results, the following areas require attention:

### 2.1 High Priority: `internal/llm` Unit Test Failures

- **Goal:** Resolve all failing unit tests in the `internal/llm` package. This is critical as these tests cover the core logic for score calculation, model handling, and LLM interactions.
- **Actions:**
    1.  **`composite_score_test.go` - `TestComputeCompositeScoreEdgeCases`:**
        *   Investigate `NaN_values` failure: Debug how NaN inputs are processed by `ComputeCompositeScoreWithConfidenceFixed` and ensure the "default" or "ignore" handling (based on `handle_invalid` in `CompositeScoreConfig`) is correctly implemented and asserted.
        *   Analyze `ignore_invalid_with_config_override`: Verify that when `handle_invalid` is set to "ignore", invalid scores (NaN, Inf) are correctly excluded from calculations, and this is reflected in the test assertions.
        *   Examine `duplicate_model_scores_-_should_use_last_one`: Review the logic in `processScoresByPerspective` or similar functions to ensure that if multiple scores for the same model exist, the intended one (e.g., the last one processed) is used for calculation.
    2.  **`model_name_handling_test.go` - `TestComputeWithMixedModelNames`:**
        *   Debug the score calculation (likely `ComputeCompositeScoreWithConfidenceFixed` and its helpers like `MapModelToPerspective`) when dealing with model names that have different casings, leading/trailing spaces, or vendor prefixes (e.g., "google/gemini-pro" vs. " google/gemini-pro "). Ensure model names are normalized before lookup in `CompositeScoreConfig`.
    3.  **`score_manager_integration_test.go`:**
        *   **`TestIntegrationUpdateArticleScore`:** Carefully review the `sqlmock` expectations. The errors indicate that the `ScoreManager` is not performing the expected database operations (UPDATE statements for `articles` table) or is using different values than the test expects. This could be an issue in the `ScoreManager` logic or an incorrect mock setup.
        *   Verify the `CalculateScore` method of the `ScoreCalculator` (likely `DefaultScoreCalculator`) returns the expected score and confidence based on the test's input `LLMScore` data.
        *   Check `ProgressManager` interactions within `ScoreManager` to ensure status, step, and percentage are updated as expected by the test.
        *   **`TestIntegrationUpdateArticleScoreCalculationError` & `TestScoreManagerIntegrationCalculateScoreError`:** Examine how errors from `ScoreCalculator.CalculateScore` are propagated and handled within `ScoreManager.UpdateArticleScore`. Ensure error messages are correctly set in `ProgressManager` and that the overall function returns an error that matches the test's expectation.
 - **Supporting Documentation:** A dedicated LLM test fixes plan should be created and referenced here.

### 2.2 Medium Priority: `scripts/test.cmd` Script Error

- **Goal:** Identify and fix the PowerShell error "`. was unexpected at this time.`" in `scripts/test.cmd`.
- **Actions:**
    1.  Review the final sections of `scripts/test.cmd`, particularly around how the Go server process is stopped and how environment variables are cleared or reset.
    2.  The error might be related to an unterminated command, an issue with `Stop-Process`, or an incorrect conditional statement in PowerShell.
    3.  Ensure the script reliably exits with code 0 when tests (Newman assertions) pass.

### 2.3 Low Priority: Test Suite Clarification & Missing Collections

- **Goal:** Improve clarity and completeness of the test suites.
- **Actions:**
    1.  **Clarify Test Suite Purpose:** Determine if `essential`, `backend`, and `api` arguments for `scripts/test.cmd` are *intended* to run the same `postman/unified_backend_tests.json` collection.
        *   If so, update `docs/testing.md` to reflect this and consider simplifying the script.
        *   If not, identify the correct Postman collections for `backend` and `api` tests and update `scripts/test.cmd` to call them.
    2.  **Address Missing Test Collections:** As noted in `docs/testing.md`, the collections for `all`, `debug`, and `confidence` are missing (`extended_rescoring_collection.json`, `debug_collection.json`, `confidence_validation_tests.json`).
        *   Plan for the creation or acquisition of these collections to enable these test suites. This is likely a longer-term task.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  Begin by addressing the **`internal/llm` unit test failures** as these are critical for application correctness. Focus on one test file at a time (e.g., `composite_score_test.go`).
2.  Concurrently or subsequently, investigate the **`scripts/test.cmd` script error**.
3.  Once core functionality is stable and unit tests are passing, revisit the **test suite clarification and missing collections**.

This plan will be used to guide the debugging and fixing process.
