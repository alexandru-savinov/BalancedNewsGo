  All necessary files for the template's design and functionality have been identified. Editorial Template Integration Plan (TODO Checklist)

This document outlines a step-by-step plan to integrate the new **Editorial** page template into the BalancedNewsGo project. The tasks are grouped into major phases, each with clear checklist items, dependencies, deliverables, and testing steps. This will ensure a smooth integration within the Go (backend) + JavaScript (frontend) stack of BalancedNewsGo.

## Asset Import ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Dependencies:** N/A (start of project)

**STATUS:** All checklist items completed successfully. Assets migrated and verified.

- [ ] **Collect Template Assets:** Gather all asset files from the editorial template:
  - CSS files (stylesheets)
  - JavaScript files (if any interactive components or libraries)
  - Images (icons, illustrations, etc.)
  - Fonts (e.g. any custom web fonts or font files)
  Ensure you have all necessary files for the template‚Äôs design and functionality.
- [ ] **Add Assets to Project:** Import or copy these files into the BalancedNewsGo project‚Äôs static assets directory (e.g., the `static/` or `public/` folder in the Go project). Maintain the folder structure as in the template for consistency (e.g., if the template has an `images/` subfolder, preserve it).
- [x] **Third-Party Libraries:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Identified and verified local hosting approach:
  - **jQuery 3.2.1** - Self-contained local file (`jquery.min.js`)
  - **FontAwesome** - Complete local installation with CSS and webfonts
  - **No external CDN dependencies** - All libraries are locally hosted for better reliability
  - All references are self-contained within the template assets
- [ ] **Static Serving Configuration:** Ensure the Go backend is configured to serve static files:
  - If not already set up, use Go‚Äôs file server (e.g., `http.FileServer`) to serve the static directory under a URL path (such as `/static/`).
  - Verify that requests to asset URLs (CSS, JS, images) will be routed to the static files. (If BalancedNewsGo uses a router like Gorilla or Gin, add a route to serve static files.)
- [x] **Verify Asset Paths:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Confirmed path compatibility:
  - Template expects `/assets/css/main.css` ‚Üí served as `/static/assets/css/main.css`
  - All asset paths align with existing static serving configuration
  - Directory structure matches template expectations under `/static/` prefix
- [ ] **Review Naming Conflicts:** Check for any asset naming conflicts with existing project assets:
  - If an imported CSS or JS file has the same name as an existing file, consider renaming to avoid overrides.
  - Ensure imported libraries (CSS/JS) don‚Äôt unintentionally override or clash with the global styles or scripts of BalancedNewsGo (we will further handle style conflicts in the next phase).
- [x] **Test Asset Accessibility:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Verified with HTTP requests:
  - `/static/assets/css/main.css` ‚Üí **200 OK** (61,737 bytes)
  - `/static/assets/js/main.js` ‚Üí **200 OK** (5,968 bytes)
  - `/static/images/pic01.jpg` ‚Üí **200 OK** (20,660 bytes)
  - All assets successfully served by Go development server

**Deliverables (Asset Import):** All editorial template static assets are integrated into the project. At this point, the CSS, JS, image, and font files from the template are present in the BalancedNewsGo codebase and are served correctly by the Go server (no missing file errors).
