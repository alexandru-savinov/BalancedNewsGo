## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
```powershell

netstat -an | findstr :8080

# Try different port
$env:PORT = "8081"
go run ./cmd/server
```

### HTMX Not Working
```powershell
# Ensure API handlers are enabled
$env:USE_API_HANDLERS = "true"

# Check server logs for errors
# Look for "Using API-based template handlers" message
```

### Fragments Not Loading
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify server is running on http://localhost:8080
3. Test health endpoint: http://localhost:8080/healthz
4. Check Network tab for failed requests

### Performance Issues
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check server resource usage
3. Verify database is not locked
4. Monitor network request times

## Advanced Testing

### Load Testing
```powershell
# Test fragment endpoint performance
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -s -o /dev/null http://localhost:8080/api/fragments/articles

# Test with filters
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -s -o /dev/null "http://localhost:8080/api/fragments/articles?bias=left&page=2"
```

### Cache Testing
1. Load articles page
2. Apply filters multiple times
3. Check server logs for cache hits
4. Verify response times improve

### Error Handling Testing
1. Stop the server while using the app
2. Try to filter or navigate
3. Observe error messages
4. Restart server and verify recovery
