6. **`debug-htmx.spec.ts`** - Debug HTMX functionality (not found in retrieval but likely exists)
7. **`debug-sse-direct.spec.ts`** - Debug SSE direct connection

### Overlapping Tests (CONSOLIDATE)

1. **Mobile Responsiveness Tests**:
   - `mobile-responsiveness.spec.ts` - Full mobile testing
   - `mobile-responsiveness-simple.spec.ts` - Simplified mobile testing
   - **Action**: Merge into single optimized mobile test file

2. **Source Management Tests**:
   - `source-management-comprehensive.spec.ts` - Complete workflow testing
   - `source-management-focused.spec.ts` - Core functionality subset
   - **Action**: Remove focused version, ensure comprehensive covers all scenarios

### Additional Test Files Analysis

1. **`create-baseline-sources.spec.ts`** - Test data setup (PRESERVE if needed for CI/CD)
2. **`reanalysis-button-real-user.spec.ts`** - Real user experience testing (PRESERVE)
3. **`test-enable-disable.spec.ts`** - Enable/disable functionality (EVALUATE for consolidation)

## CI/CD Configuration Issues

### Current Reporter Configuration
- Mixed usage of `--reporter=list` and `--reporter=dot`
- Inconsistent across different CI/CD stages
- Verbose output in some stages

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Standardize on `--reporter=dot`** for concise CI/CD output
2. **Optimize test execution order** for faster feedback
3. **Maintain 60+ second timeouts** for backend processes
4. **Use single browser (Chromium)** in CI/CD for speed

## Test Runner Script Complexity

### Current Scripts
1. **`test-runner.ps1`** - PowerShell test runner
2. **`run-e2e-tests.js`** - Node.js test runner with multiple suites
3. **`comprehensive-test-runner.ps1`** - Comprehensive PowerShell runner

### Simplification Opportunities
- Consolidate common functionality
- Reduce configuration duplication
- Streamline test suite definitions
- Maintain essential features (server health checks, result reporting)

## Core Functionality Coverage Requirements

### Must Maintain Coverage For:
1. **Admin Interface Operations**
   - Source management CRUD operations
   - Template loading and validation
   - Dashboard functionality

2. **Real-time Updates and SSE Event Handling**

   - Error handling for failed feeds

5. **HTMX Functionality Testing**
   - Dynamic content loading
   - Form submissions without page refresh
   - Real-time UI updates
   - Error handling and recovery

6. **Accessibility Compliance**
   - WCAG 2.0/2.1 compliance
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility

7. **Performance Requirements**
   - Page load performance
   - HTMX request performance
