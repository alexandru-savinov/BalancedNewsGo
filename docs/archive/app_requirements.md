# Politically Balanced News Aggregator App Requirements

## Overview
A simple web application that aggregates news from various RSS feeds, analyzes them using multiple LLMs with different political perspectives (left, center, right), and presents a balanced news feed to users with filtering and sorting options.

## Core Requirements

### 1. News Collection System
- **RSS Feed Parser**: Implement a system to fetch and parse RSS feeds from diverse news sources
- **Simple Database**: Store news articles with metadata including source, publication date, URL, title, and content
- **Import Validation**: Perform basic validation checks on imported content (duplicate detection, format validation)
- **Scheduled Updates**: Automatically fetch new content at regular intervals

### 2. LLM Analysis Framework
- **Multiple LLM Integration**: Utilize three LLMs representing left, center, and right political perspectives
- **Political Spectrum Scoring**: Each LLM analyzes and scores articles on a political spectrum
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Store analysis results as metadata with each article
- **Batch Processing**: Process new articles in batches to optimize resource usage

### 3. User Interface
- **Simple, Clean Design**: Minimalist interface focused on content
- **Feed View**: Main view showing balanced selection of news articles
- **Filtering Options**: Allow filtering by topic, source, and political leaning
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by date, relevance, or political balance
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual representation of political leaning for each article
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

### 4. User Preferences
- **Minimal User Data**: Store only essential user preferences
- **Preference Persistence**: Save user settings using simple storage mechanisms (cookies, local storage)
- **No User Accounts**: Initially, no user registration required

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript or lightweight framework (Vue.js)
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap or similar CSS framework
- **API Communication**: Fetch API for backend communication

### Backend
- **Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Flask (lightweight, suitable for MVP)
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL later)
- **RSS Parser**: Feedparser library
- **Scheduler**: APScheduler for regular feed updates

### LLM Integration
- **API-based**: Use API calls to access LLMs
- **Prompt Templates**: Standardized prompts for consistent analysis
- **Caching**: Cache LLM responses to reduce API costs
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Handle API failures gracefully

### Deployment
- **Public Access**: Publicly accessible from the start
- **Containerization**: Docker for easy deployment
- **Scalability**: Start simple, design for future scaling

## Data Flow

1. **Collection**: RSS feeds are fetched at regular intervals
2. **Storage**: New articles are validated and stored in the database
3. **Analysis**: Articles are analyzed by multiple LLMs for political leaning
4. **Enrichment**: Analysis results are stored as metadata
5. **Presentation**: Articles are presented to users based on their preferences and filters

## MVP Scope Limitations

- **Limited Sources**: Start with a curated list of 10-15 diverse news sources
- **Basic Analysis**: Initial political spectrum scoring may be simplified
- **Simple UI**: Focus on functionality over advanced features
- **Manual Calibration**: Some manual oversight of LLM analysis may be required initially

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- **User Accounts**: Optional accounts for more personalized experiences
- **Advanced Filters**: More sophisticated filtering options
- **Topic Clustering**: Group related stories across sources
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to provide feedback on political scoring
- **API Access**: Provide API access for developers
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Track coverage patterns and bias over time
