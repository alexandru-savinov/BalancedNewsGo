# NewsBalancer Go Backend
![Coverage](https://go-coverage-badge.appspot.com/badge/github.com/alexandru-savinov/BalancedNewsGo.svg)


A Go-based backend service that provides politically balanced news aggregation using LLM-based analysis with a modern, responsive web interface.

## Overview

NewsBalancer analyzes news articles from diverse sources using multiple LLM perspectives (left, center, right) to provide balanced viewpoints and identify potential biases. The application features a complete **Editorial template integration** providing a modern, responsive web interface with server-side rendering.

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ **Production Ready** - All core functionality is operational including the Editorial template web interface, database integration, search functionality, filtering, pagination, and comprehensive testing. The `essential`, `backend`, and `api` test suites pass when run with the `NO_AUTO_ANALYZE=true` environment variable.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
*   **Data Flow:** Articles are ingested from RSS feeds (`internal/rss`), stored in a SQLite database (`internal/db`, typically `news.db`), and then analyzed for political bias.
*   **LLM Analysis:** The `internal/llm` package manages LLM interactions. It uses an ensemble approach defined in `configs/composite_score_config.json`, leveraging multiple models and perspectives. A key feature is the averaging of duplicate scores and confidences if multiple results are found for the same model/perspective during an analysis pass. The composite score calculation is primarily handled by `internal/llm/composite_score_fix.go`.
*   **Database:** SQLite is used for persistence. The `llm_scores` table has a `UNIQUE(article_id, model)` constraint, which is crucial for correctly upserting LLM scores using `ON CONFLICT` SQL clauses.
*   **API & Web:** Results and functionalities are exposed via a RESTful API (`internal/api`) and a modern web interface with **Editorial template integration** (`web/templates/`).

**Editorial Template Integration:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- **Modern Web UI**: Responsive design using HTML5 UP's Editorial template
- **Server-side Rendering**: Go templates with real database data
- **Search & Filtering**: Full-text search, source filtering, and political bias filtering
- **Pagination**: Page-based navigation with state preservation
- **Performance**: Sub-20ms response times with optimized database queries
- **Mobile-friendly**: Responsive layout that works on all devices

**Latest Test Status:**
- All Go unit, integration, and end-to-end tests now pass, *with the exception of some `internal/llm` unit tests (see status table below)*.
- **Editorial template integration** fully operational with comprehensive testing completed
- Server-side rendering with real database data working perfectly
- Search, filtering, and pagination functionality verified

## Database Schema Highlights

The application relies on a SQLite database (typically `news.db`) with a schema defined in `internal/db/db.go`. Key tables include `articles`, `llm_scores`, `feedback`, and `labels`.

A critical aspect of the `llm_scores` table is the `UNIQUE(article_id, model)` constraint. This constraint is essential for the correct functioning of the LLM scoring pipeline, particularly when updating scores using `ON CONFLICT` SQL clauses, ensuring that scores for a given article and model are properly upserted (updated if existing, or inserted if new).
### Database Migrations

This project uses [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) to manage schema changes.
Migrations reside in the `migrations/` directory. To apply them, install the `migrate` CLI and run:

```bash
go install -tags "sqlite" github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest
migrate -path ./migrations -database "sqlite3://news.db" up
```

## Running Tests

Refer to the **[Testing Guide](docs/testing.md)** for detailed instructions on running different test suites (unit, backend, all, debug), analyzing results, and debugging.

**Test Suite Alignment:** The various test suites are designed to be complementary, targeting different aspects of the application to ensure comprehensive quality assurance:
*   **Unit Tests (`go test ./...`)**: Focus on validating individual Go packages and functions in isolation.
*   **Backend Integration Tests (`scripts/test.cmd backend`)**: Verify the interactions between different internal components of the backend system.
*   **API Tests (`scripts/test.cmd api`)**: Perform black-box testing of the application's API endpoints, ensuring the public contract is met.
*   **Aggregated Suites (`scripts/test.cmd all`)**: Run a combination of tests for broader coverage.
*   **Essential Tests (`scripts/test.cmd essential`)**: Cover core functionality described as essential for basic operation.

**Important Note on Testing:** Due to concurrency issues with SQLite and background LLM analysis tasks triggered by some API calls, tests involving Newman (`backend`, `api`, `essential`, `all`, `debug`, `confidence`) require the `NO_AUTO_ANALYZE=true` environment variable to be set. The provided `test.cmd` and `test.sh` scripts handle this automatically. This prevents tests from failing due to database locks (`SQLITE_BUSY`) caused by contention between the test runner and background analysis.

Additionally, the database schema includes a `UNIQUE(article_id, model)` constraint on the `llm_scores` table to ensure SQL queries using `ON CONFLICT` clauses work correctly when updating ensemble scores. This prevents errors like `SQL logic error: ON CONFLICT clause does not match any PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint` during test execution.

### Common Test Issues and Solutions

1. **Port Conflicts**:
   ```powershell
   # Kill processes using port 8080
   Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | 
      Select-Object -ExpandProperty OwningProcess | 
      ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_ -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue }
   ```
   *Note: This error commonly occurs if another instance of the server is already running, or if another application is using port 8080. This can happen when using `make run` or `go run cmd/server/main.go` if the port is not free.*

2. **Database Locks**:
   ```powershell
   # Kill server processes
   Get-Process -Name "go", "newbalancer_server" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
   
   # Delete database file
   Remove-Item news.db -Force
   ```

3. **Database Corruption**: If you encounter persistent database corruption issues, use the database recreation script:
   ```powershell
   # Reset the database automatically
   ./recreate_db.ps1
   ```
   This script backs up existing data, resets the database with proper schema, and verifies integrity. See [Testing Guide](docs/testing.md) for more details on database maintenance.

4. **Missing Collections**: Some test suites require collections that may not be present. Focus on the `essential` and `backend` tests if you encounter missing collection errors.

### Common Test Commands

- Run Go unit tests:
  ```
  go test ./...
  ```
- Run backend integration tests:
  ```bash
  # Windows
  scripts/test.cmd backend
  # Linux/macOS
  scripts/test.sh backend 
  ```
- Run API tests:
  ```bash
  # Windows
  scripts/test.cmd api
  # Linux/macOS
  scripts/test.sh api 
  ```
- Run the complete test suite (essential, extended, confidence):
  ```bash
  # Windows
  scripts/test.cmd all
  # Linux/macOS
  scripts/test.sh all 
  ```
- Run essential tests only:
  ```bash
  # Windows
  scripts/test.cmd essential
  # Linux/macOS
  scripts/test.sh essential 
  ```
- Generate HTML report from latest results:
  ```bash
  # Windows
  scripts/test.cmd report
  # Linux/macOS
  scripts/test.sh report
  ```
- Clean test results:
  ```bash
  # Windows
  scripts/test.cmd clean
  # Linux/macOS
  scripts/test.sh clean
  ```

See `scripts/test.cmd help` or `scripts/test.sh help` for all available commands.

## Development

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure RSS feed sources in `configs/feed_sources.json`
3. Set up LLM API keys in `.env`

### API Contract Validation Tools

Our project uses tools to validate the API specification (OpenAPI).

**1. Spectral CLI:**
This tool is used for linting the OpenAPI specification. It's managed as an npm dev dependency in `package.json`. Ensure you run `npm install` (or `pnpm install`).

**2. oasdiff:**
This tool is used for detecting breaking changes between API versions. Install it using Go:
```bash
go install github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff@latest
```
Ensure that your Go binary path (typically `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` or `~/go/bin`) is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable.

**Purpose & Usage:**

The `make contract` target is crucial for maintaining API quality and stability. It performs two main functions:
1.  **Linting**: Uses Spectral CLI to check the OpenAPI specification (`docs/swagger.json`) against a defined ruleset (`.spectral.yaml`) for style consistency, completeness, and best practices.
2.  **Breaking Change Detection**: Uses `oasdiff` to compare the current API specification against the last known version (backed up as `swagger.json.bak`) to identify any changes that could break existing client integrations.

**Common Contract Validation Workflow:**

1. Run `make docs` to generate or update the Swagger documentation from your code.
2. Run `make contract` to validate the API specification.
3. If validation fails:
   - For linting errors: Check the handler annotations in your Go files (`internal/api/api.go`, `cmd/server/main.go`).
   - For breaking changes: Review if the change was intentional and consider versioning your API if necessary.

**API Annotation Best Practices:**

When documenting API endpoints with Swagger annotations, ensure:
- Every handler has a unique `@ID` attribute
- Handler tags match those defined in the global annotations (`@tag.name` in `cmd/server/main.go`)
- Response models use fully qualified types that exist in your codebase
- Every endpoint has proper descriptions, parameters, and response types

**Pre-commit Hook:**
To automate these checks, a pre-commit hook is recommended. 

*   **Manual Setup:** To set this up manually:
    1.  Create/edit the file `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
    2.  Paste the script content (provided in the project's `docs/PR/makefile_test_results.txt` or by the setup assistant).
    3.  Make it executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit` (on Linux/macOS).
    This hook will automatically run `make docs` and then `make contract` before each commit, preventing commits with API contract violations.

**Interpreting Errors:**

*   **Spectral Errors:** Linting errors from Spectral will point to issues in your OpenAPI specification, often originating from the Go code comments used to generate it. Address these by correcting the annotations in your Go handlers or models.
*   **`oasdiff` Errors:** Breaking change errors indicate that a modification to the API (e.g., removing a field, changing a data type) is not backward-compatible. Carefully review these changes. If intentional, the API version might need to be incremented. If unintentional, revert the change.

Regularly running `make contract` and using the pre-commit hook helps catch API design issues early, ensuring a more robust and reliable API.

### Running Locally

Start the server using the Go command:
```
go run cmd/server/main.go
```
Or using the Makefile, which typically builds the executable (e.g., to `./bin/newbalancer_server`) and then runs it:
```
make run
```

This will start the server on port 8080 by default. You can then access the web interface at http://localhost:8080.
*Note: If you encounter a "port already in use" error (e.g., `listen tcp :8080: bind: Only one usage of each socket address...`), ensure no other processes are using port 8080. See "Port Conflicts" under "Common Test Issues and Solutions" above.*
