# Unit Test Implementation Plan

## Business Logic Tests (Priority: HIGH)

### Score Calculation Tests
Current implementation in `score_calculator_test.go` includes:
- Basic score calculation scenarios
- Edge cases for confidence calculation
- Model name handling
- Missing/invalid data handling

### Required Additional Test Coverage
1. **Score Range Validation**
   - [ ] Comprehensive boundary tests for -1.0 to 1.0 range
   - [ ] Step tests at 0.1 intervals
   - [ ] Edge case handling for scores at exact boundaries

2. **Score Normalization Functions**
   - [ ] Test normalization for different input ranges
   - [ ] Verify preservation of relative score distances
   - [ ] Test handling of extreme value clusters

3. **Confidence Calculation**
   - [ ] Extended metadata parsing tests
   - [ ] Confidence aggregation with missing data
   - [ ] Confidence boundary conditions

### Implementation Priority Order
1. Score Range Validation (Highest Priority)
   - Critical for ensuring score boundaries are respected
   - Foundation for all other scoring functionality
   - Direct impact on production reliability

2. Score Normalization (Medium-High Priority)
   - Essential for consistent scoring across different sources
   - Important for scoring accuracy
   - Affects overall system reliability

3. Confidence Calculation (Medium Priority)
   - Important for score quality assessment
   - Required for proper weighting in aggregations
   - Impacts user trust in results

## Success Criteria
- Unit Test Coverage: â‰¥90% for core business logic
- All boundary conditions tested
- Performance: Unit test execution <30 seconds

## Implementation Status
Current Coverage: ~75% (estimated)
Target Coverage: 90%
Remaining Work: 15% coverage increase needed

## Next Steps
1. Implement boundary test suite
2. Add normalization test cases
3. Expand confidence calculation tests
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Set up continuous coverage monitoring
