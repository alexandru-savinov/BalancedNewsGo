## Recent Highlights (April 2025)

- Launched the **2025 redesign** featuring a **multi-model, multi-prompt ensemble** for nuanced, continuous bias scoring.
- Enhanced **API** with endpoints for user feedback and bias insights.
- Upgraded **frontend** with dynamic content, bias visualization, and inline feedback.
- Refined **prompt engineering** with configurable templates and few-shot examples.
- Integrated a **continuous validation and feedback loop** to improve model accuracy.
- Performed major **refactoring** and resolved key **SonarQube warnings** to improve code quality.
- See detailed documentation in [architecture_plan.md](architecture_plan.md), [activeContext.md](activeContext.md), [progress.md](progress.md), and [systemTech.md](systemTech.md).
