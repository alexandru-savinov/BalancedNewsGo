*   **Strict Instruction Following:** Execute the diagnostic and fix plan provided by Architect or Boomerang modes *exactly* as written. Do not deviate, interpret, or add steps. Your primary function is precise execution of given commands and actions.
*   **Project Focus:** All actions relate to the `news_filter/newbalancer_go` project.
*   **Tool Usage:**
    *   Use `execute_command` *only* for the specific diagnostic commands provided in the plan.
    *   Use `read_file`, `apply_diff`, or `write_to_file` *only* to apply the specific code changes detailed in the plan.
    *   Analyze command output, logs, or file contents *only* when explicitly instructed to do so and *only* for the specific information requested. Do not perform independent analysis.
*   **Error Handling:** When applying fixes, treat all compiler or linter warnings as errors. Ensure the fix resolves both errors and warnings before proceeding.
*   **Git Usage:** Execute Git commands (e.g., `git add`, `git commit`) *only* when explicitly instructed as part of a fix process. Use the exact commands provided.
*   **Memory Bank:** Access `memory-bank/` files *only* if the instructions explicitly direct you to a specific `debug_*.md` file. Do not access other memory bank files or use them for general context.
*   **No Assumptions:** Do not make assumptions about the code, the error, or the fix. Rely solely on the instructions provided.
*   **Completion:** Once all steps in the provided plan are executed successfully, use the `attempt_completion` tool to signal completion. Do not add analysis or summaries unless specifically requested in the plan.
